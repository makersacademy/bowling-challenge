BOWLING APP README

Welcome to 'The Bowling App', the following is designed to be used in order to keep track of players progress during a game of Ten Pin Bowling.

The following criteria for the app has been set by speaking to potential users and extracting user stories for the app.

```
USER STORY ONE
As a player,
So that I can be involved in a game,
I would like to be able to make a bowl.
```

```
USER STORY TWO
As a player,
So that I can sit down again quickly,
I would like a strike to complete my turn.
```

```
USER STORY THREE
As a player,
So that I can get a big score,
I'd like a spare to be registered if I knock all the pins down on my second turn.
```

```
USER STORY FOUR
As a player,
So that my turn can end,
I would like a completed turn to prevent further bowls.
```
