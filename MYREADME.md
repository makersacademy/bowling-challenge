=================
![Alt Text](https://i.gifer.com/Tz9.gif)

To run Bowling Game:
1. Open Console
2. create new game - for example game = Game.new
3. to roll a ball - game.roll(pins_knocked_down) for example game.roll(4)
4. to find out current score - game.current_score

Unfortunately Jesus Quintana wouldn't be happy with my scorecard as all his strikes wont get extra points.
