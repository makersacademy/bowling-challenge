# Bowling Yo!
## Javascript Bowling scorecard with user interface [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/StuBehan/bowling-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/StuBehan/bowling-challenge)

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/StuBehan/bowling-challenge.git`
- Get yourself to the directory and `npm install`
- Use the test suite `npm test`
- Or open `SpecRunner.html` with a live server
- Open `index.html` with a live server and try out the UI
- Only enter valid bowling scores as numbers in to the UI, it does not do any validation at this time

I know this Readme is a bit thread bare, but I have created a guide concurrently with this project which covers all of the packages I used in this repo, you can find that [here](https://github.com/StuBehan/npm-eslint-jasmine-guide).

Testing on `interface.js` is to come once I work out how to test jQuery!
