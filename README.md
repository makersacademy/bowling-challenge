# Bowling challenge
## Makers Academy weekend challenge to create an app to score a game of ten pin bowling

[Challenge Specification](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge)
## Tech:

Javascript - Jasmine 

## Setup:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/jbropho/bowling-challenge
   ```
   * Launch /index.html in your browser
   * Open the developer tools and navigate to the console
   * To input a roll, call game.play(score)
   * To view the current total call game.score()

## Approach
In this challenge I attempted to design my application so that a user interface could be added at a later time with
ease. As the end of the second day was approaching I began to realise that adding a user interface
would mean rushing and potentialy degrading my code quality. I decided to focus on refactoring and maintaining code 
quality as extra features can be added at a later date.

## Positives
* Full test driven design with comprehensive feature testing
* Wrote concise, DRY tests with the use of before hooks and helper methods
* Kept a potentialy logically complex challenge clean and maintainable 

## If I had more time
* Build a front end using Jquery, Jquery Ui and Boostrap 4

## Focus for the next week
* Continued focus on team work and communication while entering the second week of team work
