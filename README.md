Bowling Challenge
=================

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

To-Do
=======

* Refactor back - separate out responsibilities into different objects.
* Refactor front - separate out into different functions.
* Refactor tests - use helper functions (loops, etc.)
* It should know when to change frame/roll.
* Tenth frame - separate object/function for this?
* Two strikes in a row? Three strikes? etc...
* All spares and final frame?
* Perfect game - currently not scoring correctly.
