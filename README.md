Bowling Challenge
=================

## Setup

1. In the command line, navigate to the folder you would like to store the Bowling Calculator

2. In the command line, paste the following:

`Git clone https://github.com/wirsindpapst/bowling-challenge`

3. To run the calculator, type 'open specRunner.html' into the command line, the Google Chrome Developer Tab will display a random scorecard


## Notes on the build

* As the script automatically generates bowling scores, as opposed to taking a user entry it is essentially useless
* The build covers the following use cases:
    * A perfect game
    * A spare in the final frame
    * A strike in the final frame
    * A gutter game
