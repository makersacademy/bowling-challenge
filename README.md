Bowling Challenge
=================

This program scores a game of bowling for one player inputting their own scores into the program.

**Approach**

* I built up the logic of this game from deciding that I would test for 4 different games, that hopefully cover all the rules of bowling:

1. gutter game: player does not knock down any pins
2. my average game: player knocks some pins down, never more than 9 in a frame.
3. spare: player scores a spare in their game
4. strike: player scores a strike in their game.

* the score card should look something like this:
