Bowling Challenge
=================

Task: 
-----

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

Completed so far:
-----

* Scorecard calculates scores for a normal game and a game with strikes ans spares
* Scorecard calculates scores for a perfect game and any game that has a strike on the tenth frame with 2 extra rolls

To do:
-----

* Currently, I feel as if my code does not adhere to SOLID principles as much as I would like.
* There are a few edge cases which I have not tested for, so I would like to test those and fix any issues those tests bring up.
* Create a user interface.

How to run:
-----

* Presently, the only way to interact with the scorecard is through Chrome console or something similar.
