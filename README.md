###Bowling Challenge###

The purpose of the Bowling Challenge is to test the knowledge of and skills in JavaScript, Jasmine, JQuery and Ajax gained over the previous week to build a working bowling scorecard. The server is generated and run using Sinatra. The challenge is outlined in the [Instructions](./Instructions.md) and is to be completed during lab week; the progress is to be submitted by 09:00 on Monday 27th April.

Although this is late, and progress has been really slow, I have continued plugging away at it as it is giving me a nice basic-level understanding of Jasmine and JavaScript in general.
