Bowling Challenge
=================

Task:
-----

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

User Guide:
-----------
* To install simply fork and clone this repository
* Either load the scripts in a custom html file or run in a JS console.
* to roll a ball use the command `player.roll(frame.pins);`
* Keep rolling to play a full game.
* at any time if you would like to see your current total-score use the command `game.calculateTotalScore();`
