=================

I need to refacotor the total() function.
I'm conflicted on my use of '#' for private functions. I used jshint and eslint and it came back as an error,
obviously it's not standard practice to use it, but if behaves like I want it and it can't accessed outside of the class,
what's the harm in using it like this?

## What I've got so far
It calculates the score for a full game. I haven't checked the score of a partial game. I've only got one test for edge cases,
calculating a partial game should be relatively straight forward by adding restrictions or some sort of output to respresent
a spare or strike, just to give some sort of feedback to the player that it can't be calculated at this time.


### Feedback
I'm mostly happy with what I have written. I'm not happy with my total() function and I need to tests for more edge cases.
I would like feedback on what I can do differntly and how to improve on what I've already done.
It seems I haven't understood encapsulation and that would possibly help me refactor a lot of my functions.
