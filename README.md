As a player
I want to be able to record the number of pins
knocked down on both bowls of each frame

As a player
So I know how well I am doing
I want to be able to see my total score at all times during the game

As a player
If I get a strike (10 pins on first bowl of frame) the frame ends immediately
(I do not get second bowl). My score for that round will be 10 plus a bonus of the number of pins knocked down on the next two bowls.

If I get a half strike (10 pins over two bowls) I get a bonus for that round eqaul to the number of pins knocked down on my next one go.
