Bowling Challenge
=================

## The Task

The task was to create a program that can record and sum the scores for a game of 10-pin bowling. 
The purpose of this challenge was to practice Javascript and writing tests in Jest.

* The following features have been created and tested:

    * Gutter game
    * One frame
    * Multiple frames
    * Spares
    * Strikes

* Future features yet to be implemented include:

    * Final Frame - additional rolls
    * UI

## Code Review

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Note that referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want.
