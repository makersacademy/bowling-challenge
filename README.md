Bowling Challenge
=================

This is my attempt at a Bowling Scorecard Program built in Javascript. I used a TDD approach (via Jest) which I hope will reflect in my tests. 

User Stories
------------

```
Main User Story:

So I can see my results
I want to be able to count and sum the scores of my bowling game.

Future Improvements

I would like to implement a user interface. This can be achieved via the command line or as an animated web-page.
