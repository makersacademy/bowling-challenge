**Bowling Challenge**
=================
Week 5 Makers Academy - Bowling Challenge.

Description
------------

Our challenge for week 5 of Makers Academy was to create a bowling scorecard application.

The rules follow traditional ten-pin rules, as follows;

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins.
In every frame the player can roll one or two times ( 3 in the last frame).
The bonus for a strike is 2 additional rolls. The bonus for a spare is 1 extra roll.
The actual score of each frame is the number of pins knocked down plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

Installation/Dependencies
--------------------------
- Built with Javascript & jQuery running in the browser
- Tested with Jasmine v2.0 

The front end is still in development. To view tests and check current state in the browser `git clone` this repo and `open SpecRunner.html`.
