**week 5/6 / weekend challenge**

# The challenge

This weekend challenge is to create the logic behind a Bowling game.

## User stories

```
As a User
So that I can play bowling
I need to be able to start a new game

```

# Implementation

My implementation was driven by acceptance unit test cycles.

## How to use it
- First clone this project to your local machine.
```
$ git clone
```
- Then navigate into the folder that contains it
```
$ cd bowling-challenge
```
- Open the SpecRunner.html to see all the passing tests.
```
$ open SpecRunner.html
```
Finally play in the Console of your browser Developer Tools the game
```
game = new Game90;
game.play();
>>
```

## Future improvements
