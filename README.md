This is a bowling scorecard app that tracks the score for a single player in a game of ten pin bowling. All [Traditional Ten Pin Scoring Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Traditional_scoring) have been satisfied in this app.

### Instructions
```
$ git clone https://github.com/saypop/bowling-challenge.git
$ cd bowling-challenge
$ node app.js
```

You might need to install node and npm if the above doesn't work.

To see Jasmine test results
```
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

### Notes

I did hella learning on this challenge, it took me from JS bafoon to launching my first Node.js app on the real life interwebs. I can now confidently say that I can learn a new programming language independently. I also ramped up my html and CSS game significantly - it is at least no longer torture.

All that said there is a lot I still need to learn. My git commit habits are not ideal, I was commiting 5 or so tests at a time which lead to a lot of wasted time when I wrote in bugs.
My code is far from fluent, I'm still learning JS so this app is written in what I like to call ratchet code - it's ratchet because it only looks good when you're drunk and I would never publicly admit to having wrote it... üòè
I also still need to figure out how to run Capybara style tests for Node apps - I think I need to use Mocha but have not figured it out this time.
