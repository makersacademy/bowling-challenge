## Notes

I based my first attempt at this challenge on the Uncle Bob - Bowling Game kata and investigated the solutions and approaches to the kata.
Unfortunately after going over the kata a few times and starting work on the UI, I realized that the solutions I looked at lacked specific outputs for the UI and handling for the final frame. This stumped me. So I went back and started from scratch and tried to build the game up from frame to game using TDD. This worked out a little better but I came unstuck working on the final frame issue.
