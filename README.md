Bowling Challenge - INCOMPLETE
=================

```
As a bowling player,
So that I can record my score during a game,
I want to be able to record my score on a scorecard.

As a bowling player,
So that I can enter my score correctly,
I want to be able to see the possible number of pins left.

As a bowling player,
So that I can see strikes (X) and spares (/) displayed in the correct form,
I want those symbols to replace numbers and be shown on my scorecards, when applicable.

As a bowling player,
So that the score is accurate,
I want to see the total of a frame only after strikes and spare bonuses have been calculated.

As a bowling player,
So that I can start a new game,
I want to be able to play again.
```

Reflections
----
Despite the vast amount of research (and exercising) carried out over the week, this challenge proved that I still find JavaScript rather daunting. I tried to develop the task following [Robert C. Martin's presentation](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata) and a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qA_MjNmpVU). I feel like I didn't really achieve much. Even if the few tests I wrote are passing, I believe there is something wrong in the code (e.g. _NaN_ messages when `console.log`ing `score()`. Hopefully, there will be some time during the week to discuss my concerns with classmates and coaches, to eventually try and improve the code next weekend.

Some positivity
----
- I am becoming more confident with writing user stories and modelling diagrams.
- Despite the complexity behind the score calculation, I will always enjoy playing bowling.
