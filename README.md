## Keeping Score

_Built in JavaScript, tested with Jasmine_

The aim of this app was to count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

After spending a few days grappling with the logic of the scoring I finally managed to pass all the tests with various scenarios as you can see below.

One important lesson which I have learnt from completing this challenge is to diagram and take small steps. I spent many hours on trying to get the strike and spare logic working and failing to pay attention to the initial scoring. I finally completed the challenge by creating a new git branch and starting all over with better diagrams

Some of the front end design for the table has been inspired by another repo. I have used google fonts for the lobster family font and used [colorhunt.co](http://colorhunt.co/) for the various colour codes.
