Makers Week 5 Bowling Challenge
</h1>

```
Note !! The challenge is not yet completed.
I still need to write the algorithm to calculate a strike.

```

<h4 align='center'>
To Use Application.
</h4>

- Fork and clone this repo.
- In terminal ``cd into bowling-challenge``.
- cd into ``jasmine-standalone-3``.
- Type ``open  SpecRunner.html`` to run test.

<h4 align='center'>
How It Works.
</h4>

- A user is able to create a ``new Bowling`` instance.

- A user is able to check the current frame.

- A user can roll a ball and check how many pins were pinned down.

- It gives an error if a user trys to pin down more than ten pins in a single frame.

- The frame changes as the game goes on.

- The application can calculate a spare.

- It can handle complex spares.

<h4 align='center'>
To Do.
</h4>

- Handle Strikes.
- Check all edge cases.
- Implement the interface section of the application.
- Refactor Codebase.

<h4 align='center'>
Difficulties.
</h4>

```
This is one of the most complicated challenges I have done so far at Makers.
This is due to the fact that, I had to learn and understand the rules of bowling.
I can say for a fact that I am not a fan of the game!! 
But anyways, it took me about a day and a half to fully understand the game and its rules.
```
- Understanding the game.
- calculating spares.

<h4 align='center'>
What Would I Do Differently.
</h4>

- Watch a bowling game to understand the rules.
- Plan well, using diagrams on how the application would work.
- Commit in small quantities and push to github more frequently.
- Take it easy and not be hard on myself when algorithm for spare was not working.
