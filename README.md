#### Bowling Rules ####

* A game is a total of 10 frames.
* There are 2 rolls in each frame.
  * The player can roll 2 more times in the last frame if they get a strike in the first roll.
  * The player can roll 1 more time in the last frame if they get a spare in the first 2 rolls.
* A spare occurs if the player knocks down all 10 pins within a frame.
  * A spare is worth 10 points, plus the value of the player's next roll.
* A strike occurs if the player knocks down all 10 pins within the first roll of a frame.
  * A strike is worth 20 points, plus the value of the player's next 2 rolls.
* A gutter game occurs if the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).
* A perfect game occurs if the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame).

#### CRC Cards ####

In the end I decided against having the Roll class as it would only be responsible for holding a single number which could be easily transferred to an attribute of the Frame class.
