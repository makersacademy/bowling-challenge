**week 5/6 / weekend challenge**

# The challenge

This weekend challenge is to create the logic behind a Bowling game in Javascript. The game should keep track of the current score, strikes, spares and all the bowling jazz as per the 'ten pin bowling' rules (more about those rules here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling)


# Implementation

The implementation was driven by acceptance unit test cycles, using Jasmine as the testing framework.
