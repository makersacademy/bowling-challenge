Bowling Challenge
=================

I completed this challenge to test what I had been learning throughout the week and to solidify the knowledge that I had gained. This challenge is a bowling scorecard which allows the user to input the score for the roll which they had just completed and the program will calculate their score incremently after each time they bowl.

My Approach to Learning a Language
===================================

The purpose of this week was to learn a new language which was Javascript. When learning languages the first thing I do is to look at some code in this language, I'll look through Github, Stackoverflow, and other programming websites. Then I will jump straight into a project which will help me to learn the syntax of the chosen language, in this case I worked through a thermostat application which can be found at: https://github.com/bradleyplater/Thermostat. I worked on that throughout Tuesday to Thursday. To learn all the syntax I needed in order to complete the Thermostat, I made sure to keep referencing the documentation when needed.
