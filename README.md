BOWLING CHALLENGE

Synopsis
--------
The task is to create a points card for a bowling game which counts and sums the scores of one player. A game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to know down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.
