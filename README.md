Bowling Challenge

 This is a static webpage that can calculate the final scores for your game of bowling.

 The first stage is to enter in the names of all the players.
 Once all players names have ben entered you can then click start game and the game scoreboard will appear.

To record a player's frame enter in the score for the first ball of the frame in the field which says first ball and the second in the field which says second ball.

 WARNING - ILLEGAL INPUTS WILL RESULT IN A FOUL and a score of 0 being recorded for the frame.

If the final frame is a strike or spare you have the chance to enter in what you got for your bonus balls. 

WARNING - FOR A STRIKE RECORD YOUR FIRST BONUS BALL IN FIRST BALL AND SECOND BONUS BALL IN SECOND BALL, DO NOT RECORD FRAME WITHOUT BOTH BALLS OR ONE OF YOUR BONUS BALLS WILL BE ASSUMED TO BE 0.

Areas to improve on:
=

 - you can start a game with 0 players.
 - no feature testing of the interface, only the model.
 - page is not as responsive as it could be.
 - if a couple of players have strikes on frame 10 you still have to record a frame for each of the players inbetween instead of skipping to the next player who's actually able to play.
 - a player's score isn't displayed frame-to-frame, only once the game is completed.
 - form styling could be a bit nicer.
 - code is ugly AF
