# Bowling Challenge in JavaScript

This is Alexis Morcrette's attempt at the Bowling Challenge in JavaScript, Makers Academy's Week 6 Weekend Challenge.

The focus for this challenge is to write high-quality code in JavaScript and Node.js, a language that we have only been learning for one week, and to deliver a bowling score program.

This challenge builds on last week's challenge, which was to write a similar program in Ruby. You can visit this project [here](https://github.com/almorcrette/bowling-challenge-ruby).

This project attempts to demonstrate the following skills:
* A coherent process to learn a new language
* Using diagramming to plan my approach to the challenge
* TDD my code
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Committing often, with good commit messages
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code

## Note on progress

I struggled with two aspects of this build that limited my progress:
* Mocking the Frame class, its instances and methods in the Game test suite
* Building a CLI that receives user input for the roles.
