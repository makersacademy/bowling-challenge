# Bowling Challenge

## Solo Project

In week 6 of the Makers course we started to learn our second language, JavaScript.

In this module, we began to learn the basics of Javascript by pairing through a series of exercises, either building on previous knowledge or discovering new concepts.

## Learning objectives

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking
  programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

As a weekend solo project, we were tasked to build a more complex coding challenge using all of these new concepts.

## The Task

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

See [instructions](instructions.md) for full details.

## How far did I get?

I was able to TDD a working solution so a score can be calculated in any scoring scenario and at any point of game.

- Features
  - [ ] Gutter game
  - [ ] One frame
  - [ ] Multiple frames
  - [ ] Spares
  - [ ] Strikes
  - [ ] Final Frame

## Installation/Usage Instructions in README

See instructions for how to download and run the tests:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ChrisHutchinson1982/bowling-challenge.git
$ cd bowling-challenge
$ jest
```

## Approach

- Object-Oriented Design
- Designed mutli class system:
  - **Frame:** _determines frame attributes such as strike, spare, score etc._
  - **Game:** _adds each role to a frame and then adds the frame to the game._
  - **Scorecard:** _initialised by an instance of game and provides a total score based on scoring methodology._
- Test-driving using Jest: Green on all integration and unit tests.
- Debugging: Using debugging techniques and error message info.
- Version control: Git and Github
- Language: Node.js

## Further considerations

- Potential for additional unit class tests using doubles to enable game and scorecard classes to be tested in isolation.
- Create a UserInterface class, allowing you to run a game from the command line.
