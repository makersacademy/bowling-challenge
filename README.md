![Diagram for Scorecount]()

# Usage

In this version of the Bowling Scorecard there is no input from the user.
- We add 9 frames with the method addFrame() to a new instance of the class, passing as an argument the score for each roll (if strike input 0 as second roll).

- After we add the last frame with the method addTenthFrame() and then we calculate the total score with the method calculateScore() which should return the correct output.

- define a variable that equals to calling the method calculateScore() once the previous steps are done and console.log that variable to see the total score calculated.

(just run the file scorecard.js to see the score for scoring only strikes!)
