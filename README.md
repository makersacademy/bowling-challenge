# Bowling Challenge

## Project

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

- A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins.

- In every frame the player can roll one or two times.

- The actual number depends on strikes and spares.

- The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

- After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

### Optional Extras

In any order you like:

- Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.
- Set up Travis CI to run your tests.
- Add ESLint to your codebase and make your code conform.
