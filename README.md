Bowling Challenge
=================

Play and count Tenpin Bowling Game.

Clone repo;
load TenPin HTML;
Use number buttons to simulate throws;
Use Display Final result to display score also during the game;
Use Clear Game to create a new game.
The game counts only according to normal ten round game;

I made two versions, one uses the prototype pattern(control.js & TenPin.js) and the other uses
a revealing module pattern (bowling.js/controlBowling.js). the functionality between the two is
identical.
