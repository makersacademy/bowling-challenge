We are using jasmine to test our javascript classes 

* To run the tests, run 'npm test' in a terminal. You should see the result in the terminal

## START THE APP

this should then start up a browser with the project

## THE PROJECT 

This project is currently not finished. 

To work it, you correctly have to enter all the scores for it to calculate your final score at the end.

In future, I would refactored my code so that we would be able to calculate the score frame by frame and be able to display this on the front end.
