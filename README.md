# Bowling Challenge #

# Rules #

A game consists of ```10 frames``` in which the player tries to know down the ```10 pins```. In every frame the player can roll ```once or twice``` depending on whether or not they get a ```strike or spare```.  

After every frame, the 10 pins are ```reset```.

The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
