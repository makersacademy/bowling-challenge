The challenge is to build a bowling scorecard (not a game), in Javascript.

## The rules ##

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins.<br/>
In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares.<br/>
The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
After every frame the 10 pins are reset.<br/>

* Strikes

The player has a strike if he knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll in a frame.<br/>
The frame ends immediately (no second roll due to no pins to hit left).<br/>
The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls.<br/>
That would be the next frame, unless the player rolls another strike.

* Spares

The player has a spare if the knocks down all 10 pins with the two rolls of a frame.<br/>
The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first roll of next frame).

* 10th frame

If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame they can roll the additional balls for the bonus.<br/>
But they can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame.<br/>
The additional roll only count for the bonus not for the regular frame count.

* Gutter Game

A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).

* Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame).<br/>
The Perfect Game scores 300 points.
