## 10 Pin Bowling Rules

- A game consists of 10 frames.
- Pins are reset after every frame.
- A player rolls twice per frame unless gets a strike.
- A strike is when all 10 pins are down first roll.
- A spare is when all 10 pins are down second roll.
- Score:
 - 1 per pin
 - bonus 1 per pin for the 2 rolls following a strike
 - bonus 1 per pin for the first roll following a spare
- If get a strike or spare in final round, get 1 or 2 extra rolls respectively. These score 1 per pin with no extra bonus.
