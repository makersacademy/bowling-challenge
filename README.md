Bowling Challenge
=================

The aim of this challenge is to produce a html page that can act as a bowling scoreboard.

Unfortunately having not read the instructions properly most of my development so far has moved towards me creating a Bowling game rather than a scoreboard. Because of this I'm going to continue to create a bowling pin game and then try and get the scorecard functionality working afterwards.

## Constructor Functions
So far there are two constructor functions:
 - Roll: Responsible for rolling a ball and returning a random number from 0 to 10.
 - Frame: Frame keeps track of the scores from the rolls within the current frame.

 Further classes will likely be Game and Scoreboard. The Game class will keep track of the Frames, and the Scoreboard will keep track of the overall scores. The Scoreboard will contain the logic that calculates the effects of strikes. I may need a further class for FinalFrame although I'm sure I can refactor it into the main Frame class.
