**Bowling Challenge**
=================
Week 5 Makers Academy - Bowling Challenge.

Description
------------

Our challenge for week 5 of Makers Academy was to create a bowling scorecard application.

The rules follow traditional ten-pin rules, as follows;

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins.
In every frame the player can roll one or two times (or 3 in the last frame).
The actual score of each frame is the number of pins knocked down plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
The bonus for a strike is 2 extra roll. The bonus for a spare is 1 extra roll.
After every frame the 10 pins are reset.
The last frame behaves differently and a maximum of 3 rolls can be made if a strike or a spare happens.

Installation/Dependencies
