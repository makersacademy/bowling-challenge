Bowling Challenge
=======================

## Synopsis

My submission for the bowling challenge. This follows all the point scoring rules, apart from handling the tenth frame. It works in my javascript, but I did not have enough time to implement it into the UI. It is TTD with Jasmine on the unit side. However, I did not manage to find out how to use Jasmine with the UI, so there are no feature tests.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript, jQuery
- HTML, CSS
- Sinatra
- Jasmine

## To Run

- Clone the repo, run bundle
- Run rackup in the terminal
- Open http://localhost:9292 in the browser
- To run the tests, open SpecRunner.html

## Job List

- Still need to test the UI
- Implement the tenth frame bonuses
