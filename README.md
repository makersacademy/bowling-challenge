# Bowling Scorecard Challenge-JavaScript

## Purpose of the project
It was design a bowling scorecard in JavaScript(JS). The focus was not on creating an interactive game, but a utility for calculating and tracking scores based on user inputs. The task aimed to solidify our understanding of JS, Objective-Oriented Programming(OOP), and Test-Driven Development(TDD).

## What we aimed to learn
Through this project, we aimed to become proficient in JS, as versatile programming language frequently used in web development. We focused on writing behavior-driven tests(BDD) with Jest, utilizing a TDD approach. We also aimed to develop a deeper understanding of OOP principles by dividing our code into separate classes with distinct responsibilities.

## What we did
We began by planning our code structure and identifying key components. Utilizing TDD, we wrote tests before implementing functionality, ensuring each class and method behaved as expected. Our project consists of separate classes for handling frames, scorecards, and user interfaces, enhancing modularity and readability. 

## What we learned
We learned the nuances of JS syntax and conventions, and gained experience in applying TDD to JS projects. We deepened our understanding of the object-oriented paradigm in JS, focusing on encapsulation and hte Single Responsibility Principle. We also learned to handle the complexity of hte bowling score rules, particularly the bonus scoring system.

## Further improvements
These are opportunities for improvements, such as handling a wider variety of user inputs and edge cases. We could extend the application into a full-fledged bowling game simulation. Additionally, adding support for multiple players could be a valuable feature.

## Issues and learning points
During the development, we found tat managing the bonus scoring system was a complex task. It underscored the importance of thorough planning and precise coding. we learned the value of TDD in helping us isolate and address issues quickly and effectively.

## Conclusion
The Bowling Scorecard Challenge in JS was a valuable exercise that provided hands-on experience with JS and TDD. It underscored the importance of good design principles and provided an opportunity to apply these principles to a complex problem. We will now check our solution against the  challenge requirements and run our test suite to ensure everything works as expected before submitting our work. The experience gained from this challenge will undoubtedly prove invaluable in our future JS development endeavors.
