# Note on solution

After initially going down a deep dark rabbit hole for a day and a half I decided to use Uncle Bob's classic javascript solution (https://github.com/hontas/bowling-game-kata) as the basis for the scoring mechanism and added some extra functionality on top. Unfortunately I ran out of time before fully completing the challenge as a player can roll past 10 frames.
