Bowling Challenge
=================

How to use
-----

* Clone this file
* Install Jasmine following these instructions https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine
* Run tests with Jasmine by typing open SpecRunner.html in the terminal
* Copy the full path of index.html into the browser to use the app

Aim of the Project
-----

The project is a bowling score card in Javascript. This was a weekend Challenge from Makers Academy. Here is the master branch, which details the criteria https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge

Functionality 
-----
* It has the full functionality of a bowling score card according to the rules of bowling, apart from if you throw a strike in the 10th round. In that instance, it allows you to just keep playing forever...
* Here's a picture of it in action and while some might think the background is tacky, they would be wrong.

* Here are my beautiful tests passing...

Goals of feedback from Tutors 
-----
* I'd love some feedback on my use of spies and mocks.
* I'd love some feedback on my "private methods" (not really private yet in Javascript, only using naming conventions) and if I tested them right.
* I know that I've left in some comments, but I think it will be helpful for me to look back at them.
* Any other feedback is of course very welcome.

What I think went well
-----

* For my first solo project in Javascript, I'm happy with it. 
* All my tests pass. I managed to research spies and doubles and used them to keep my tests isolated.
* I'm really happy that almost all of the game works as it should, according to the rules of bowling. 
* My first time using jQuery by myself was successful.


What I found challenging
------

* I found getting my spies to work very challenging. Ultimately my testing has some limitations and is not fully isolated.
* The overall structure of the model was complex, but fun to workout

What I would do if I had more time
------
* Download a linter and make my code beautiful
* Sort out the bug that happens if you roll a strike in the tenth round. 
* Research how to feature test Javascript


What I want to improve on
-----
* It took me a long time to research spies, with a lot of rabbit holes fallen into. I'm working on improving my research skills.
* After feedback from my tutor, I realised that I overtested.
