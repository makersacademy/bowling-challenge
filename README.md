I want the half strike bonus to be added to my score for that frame

As a user
If I am on fire and keep rolling strikes, so I keep within the rules

## Technology used

## How to use
To use the bowling app you will first need to clone this repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ajay233/bowling-challenge.git
```

Then, while in the bowling_challenge directory use:
```
open index.html
```

Alternatively, the app has been deployed to Surge, so you can try out the app by visiting:  https://crraazzzybowling.surge.sh

## How to play

- To play a game you will need to enter either a number between 1-9, "x" for a strike or "/" for a spare.
- Once the 10th frame and any subsequent bonus goes have been played, the game will prevent you from playing another game unless you click the reset button.


## Below are screenshots of the finished app

The app includes a bowling score table modelled after the tables used in bowling alley scoring systems.  I have included an input box for the user to input their scores.  Scores will be either 1-9, "x" for a strike, or "/" for a half strike.

Bonuses for strikes and spares are automatically worked out for the user.  To replicate the scoring systems in bowling alleys, I have prevented scores from being shown until the relevant bonuses have been applied.

When the game is over, if the user tries to enter another score they will be notified that the game is over and that they will have to reset the game to play again.  To do so, the user just has to click the "reset" button and the table will be cleared and the game and all scores will be wiped so a fresh game can begin.

## Updates/Bug Fixes
- The case of strike input no longer affects scoring i.e. you can now enter either a lower case or upper case "x" and the scoring works as normal.
- Rules have been added to the app view so the user can refer to them without having to leave the page.
- Some small styling changes have been implemented so that when scores are added, the user will not have to scroll down the page to click the "Go" and "Restart" buttons.
- The "Reset" button has been renamed to "Restart", matching the end of game pop up notice which prompts the user to click "Restart" to play a new game.
