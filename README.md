Counts and sums the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

I use only one "class" Game.

Logic for calculation is that for "regular" game 2 rolls needed for calculation to be made, for "not regular" game (strike or spare) 3 rolls needed for calculation to be made. Game ends when all frames were calculated.

For rolling I use random function to find out how many pins were hit.

I test it in jasmine.

Also worked to make visualisation. It works. Press roll and it will give results for each roll and make the calculation. Press New game to start new game.
