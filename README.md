Bowling Challenge
=================
This project is live [here](https://cazwazacz.github.io/bowling-challenge/).
---

This app sums and calculates the scores of a player for a game of bowling, taking into account all the multipliers that certain actions such as spares and strikes may entail. As of now, the app calculates correctly the outcome of a full game of bowling. However, the showing of the cumulative score while the game is in progress is not correct currently and is a work in progress.

Technologies used: Javascript, HTML and CSS with Jasmine for testing.

To run locally, first clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cazwazacz/bowling-challenge.git
```
Change into the directory and then run:
```
$ open index.html
```
To view tests, run:
```
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

Things to do:
---
- Fix the showing of the cumulative score - it currently does not work as a regular bowling scoreboard should even though the calculation of the total score is correct
- Work on CSS and styling
