Bowling Challenge
=================

My Notes
=========
1. Spent alot of time focusing on the logic of the bowling game as was incomplete from Ruby excercise.
2. Would have liked to have taken it further and made it more interactive.
3. Used different syntax for testing to get some practice and further understand how it works.
4. All tests passing.
