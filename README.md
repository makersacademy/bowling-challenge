=================

## The Task

  

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**

  

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

  

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

  ## My Process 

Attempted the bowling logic in ruby the previous week and diagramming and process is saved in that [repo](https://github.com/TamMelPer/bowling-challenge-ruby). 
Used [this](https://dev.to/joerter/bowling-game-kata-in-javascript-gi6) video to support me in my first javascipt challenge, researching + trying out the new syntax.
The class is `Game` and you can use `roll` to add the number of pins from each roll to the `scorecard` array. The `score` method will return the total once all the rolls are entered. 
You can create a new game in the console, enter your rolls and then check your score at the end.

### Next Steps

  

* Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.
