Bowling Challenge
=================

The Task
------

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript)

Implementation
-------
- Creating new frames after two rolls
- Bonus points for spares are updated
- Strikes create a new frame
- Bonus points for strikes for next two rolls, no consec strike
- Tenth frame logic
- Update scores method
- Interface shows cumulative scores and each roll for each frame

How to use
-------

- Clone the repo
- Run SpecRunner.html to run the tests or index.html to run the app

TODO
-------
- Implement a reset button so a user can play another game and a game is finished alert
- Hide buttons so user cannot roll a 9 and another 9, if a 9 is rolled, user can only click 0 or 1
- Improve layout, a table might be a good way to display the scorecard
- Refactor code and logic, unsure if the update scores method should go in the interface
