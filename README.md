Bowling, the greatest test of athleticism and skill every wrought by mankind, but more than this, it is a perfect metaphor for existence itself. For generations the scoring of this paragon of sports has been a mystery known only to the mighty **Pin Priests of Yarg**, until now!

This program accurately and with no small amount of flair, tracks and calculates the scores for a full 10 frame game of bowling.

Never again will we live under the heel of tyrants who seek to control our lives by denying us the understanding of just how one should score a strike. This program is nothing short of a manifesto for freedom, a revolution of thought, it is the absolution of all humanity!
