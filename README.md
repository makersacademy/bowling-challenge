Bowling Challenge
=================

This challenge marks my first foray into logical programming with JavaScript. The previous weekend, with Ruby, I fell into a hole when trying to figure the bonus additions of points following strikes and spares. However, this weekend I'm pleased to present a complete, fully-fledged programme for scoring bowling.

My initial thoughts with Ruby lead me to something resembling this:

My inititial code managed to calculate the scores of a gutter-game, a perfect-game, and a "one-er" (all 1s) game. But when it came to stringing spares and strikes, the code I had written was fundamentally wrong, and otherwise highly convoluted. The original ruby challenge lead me to researching the proper methodology, post-submission. I was pleased to see that we were challenged with approaching it the week after.

To explain the logic, I've retained the pseudo-code I initially placed within the files, as to clarify for anyone looking over (or myself in the future) what exactly is going on; from line to line.

I learnt that the attributes I intitially set as instance variables within the initiation of the class object could just as easily be instance variables within the '#score' function itself. The initial tracking of the frame by instance/attribute, turned into a simple defined for loop that tracked the frame and would only iterate, say, when there was a strike, or when there was no strike (see scorecardIndex += 2, as to account for an entire frame).

I like this solution and I'm pleased I could regurgitate and refactor it for JavaScript. The only issue with it currently is viewing a current score. The score is only viewable after the set 10 frames are over with.
