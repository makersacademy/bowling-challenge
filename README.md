# Bowling Challenge

This is my attempt at making a bowling scorecard. All was going smoothly until the AddBonus method took in two strikes in a row and began giving them the same bonus regardless of the rolls that came next. 

To run it, you can open the SpecRunner in your browser and use the console to play around with it. Overall, it would have been nice to have sorted out the addBonus method, but nonetheless, I was pleased with how the other parts of the program run.
