Code is tested via Jasmine.

All tests pass. Used TDD to build the program. Was initially not worrying about the bonus frame to start with and decided to handle that logic at the end. However, upon testing noticed my bonus roll was automatically accounted for based on my previous code, so happy (accidental) days.

May create an interactive UI if I have time. Will update.
