Thats Life Bowling Lanes
=================

Welcome to Thats Life Bowling Lanes where life just happens. Even if you are having the game of your life!

Remeber when you were little and you went to your friend's birthday party down at the bowling lanes and you tried to fit an extra game in even though there were only twenty minutes left??

The dreaded shutdown just before you rolled your last ball? The sound of rock hitting metal as the guards came down at the last minute and the lights went off??

Well guess what. thats life. And thats this game too.

Enjoy a lovely game of regular bowling and then see where life takes you on the final frame. Maybe you'll score that perfect 300.... But you probably won't. Cause thats life.

Enjoy!
