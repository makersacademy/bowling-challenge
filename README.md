## Bowling Challenge JS

Having struggled bringing things together in modular form in my ruby I changed to a simpler single class approach,
especially as this was going to be done in a new language. The idea would be to have just roll and score methods,
and the tests would cover gutter game, non bonus games, game including just spares, then strikes, then a perfect game.

This made it more straightforward to add bonus scores.
