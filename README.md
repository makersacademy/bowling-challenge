Bowling scorecard.

I interpreted the rules of bowling a bit differently.. Instead of it returning double the amount of points for the next roll on a spare, it returns double the amount of the next two rolls. For a strike it returns double the points for the next four rolls.
So, when you throw a strike you next two frames will give you double the amount of points. When you throw a spare, your next frame will be counted double.

The interface isn't exactly a scorecard yet, it just cumulates the score and shows you which round you're on.
