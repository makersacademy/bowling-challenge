## Bowling Scorecard Challenge in JavaScript

This is a ten-pin bowling score calculator. It's a translation of [this](https://github.com/mscwilson/bowling-challenge-ruby) Ruby project, with a jQuery UI.


### The Task
Ten-pin bowling has surprisingly [complex rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring). Essentially the score is the number of pins knocked over per round (frame), but there are bonus points if all ten pins fall after only one or two consecutive rolls.

This was the 6th weekend challenge for [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). The goal was to practise JavaScript, with a stretch goal of adding a jQuery interface.

It looks like this:
