### How to use
- Launch index.html
- Enter rolls
- Press Go!

I tried to follow SRP. I am unsure about including other class files, however it works with the browser-based app.
I'm not sure of the jquery syntax. ESLint came up with a lot of errors in my interface.js file, but I felt that at least some of them were consistent with convention that I'd seen online.

If the user inputs incorrect rolls, they will have to reset the app. Ideally, I'd rectify this.
