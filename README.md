=================

    Test time: Friday, the entire day and the weekend if you need it.
    Feel free to use Google, your notes, and your books.

Task: 
-----

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).


Logic plan: 
-----------

* the game is an array, with each frame its own array
* if roll1 = 10, add next roll1 + roll2
  * if the next roll1 = 10, add next roll1
* if roll1 + roll2 = 10, add next roll1
* if frame10, if either roll1 or roll1 + roll2 = 10, roll3
