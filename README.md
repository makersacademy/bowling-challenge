# Bowling Challenge

## The Task

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

## My application

Currently, you can choose your score for each bowl, and the total for that frame will be calculated at the end of that frame (not including strike and spare scores.)

I ran out of time to calculate a total and integrate spare and strike logic.

## Personal Reflection

This was a tough week for me. I started by thinking about what the application would look like, and had a complete mental block on how a person would interact with it. I was unable for some reason to see past just randomising the output of rolls, and only realised late Sunday evening of the first week that my interface could be interactive.

I struggle greatly with planning, and feel lost until I start coding, and I am not really sure how to approach full stack applications like this in terms of planning. Should I have planned out the interface first and worked back to the logic? I started on the logic first as this was what was most comfortable for me as I was not used to browser-based interaction.

I felt that my logic was quite clean, however the interface logic and jQuery is very messy, with an incredibly long function doing all the work.

I also could not figure out how to score strikes and spares properly, and ran out of time to do so.

## Key questions

How do I go about planning building this type of application? How do I break it down? How do I visualise it?
How much of the logic in my jQuery could be moved back to the javascript models?
