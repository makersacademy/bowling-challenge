How To Play!
=================

* Clone the github repo to your own local repository
* Run the SpecRunner.html in order to check the tests
* Run index.html in your favourite browser to check your bowling score!

Bowling Challenge
=================

This is my attempt at the very famous *Bowling Game Kata* - designed to test both logical thinking and TDD. The user story was very simple-

```
As a bowler
So I can what score I've got
I want to be able to enter my scores into a scorecard and recieve my sore
```

I was primarily tasked with building the logic for the game in Javascript. After several different iterations I found a solution that I was pleased with - and one that was relatively simple to read. Further to this I then built a fully functional front-end where users can type in their scores and get their total score in return

### Screenshots

A screenshot of the game logic - I tried to follow SRP and DRY principles as much as possible

In order for my application I needed to take the entered numbers and turn them into an array of arrays - this shows you how I did it

How To Play!
-----

* Clone the github repo to your own local repository
