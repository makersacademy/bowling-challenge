# Bowling Challenge Javascript - Chuka Okoye-Ahaneku
==================

## My Approach
* Wanted to store the number of bowling pin hits to a number so to track the score, but unable to use the same technique to track the rolls.
* Could use an empty array instead of a number to store the score better.
* Tracking rolls and score needs reworking.
* Also unable to reset the rolls constructor object with the rollsReset function.

## How to run
```
git clone https://github.com/coo990/bowling-challenge.git
cd bowling-challenege
```
