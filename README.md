# Bowling Challenge


### Approach

First of all I made a diagram to understand how the function had to communicate, what 'methods' they should have.
Then following the TDD i started to create the necessary functions.
--
In the second week following the TDD i've implemented the strike roll and removed some unnecessary variable (like the turn system) and update the interface to let it work at least with the spare rules.

## How to use it

Clone the repo
Go in the main folder with your terminal
Then run the index.html file placed in the views folder.
Enjoy!

(I got awsome graphic skills, isn't it?)

### Implemented Rules

-Gutter game
-One frame
-Multiple frames
-Spares Bonus
-Strike Bonus
-Implemented an Interface which doesn't have yet the strike bonus implemented.

### To improve if I would've had more time

-Improve the legibility of the Spare and Strike functions
-Add strike rules in the interface
-Create final frame
