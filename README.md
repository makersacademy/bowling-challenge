Bowling Challenge
=================

This is my solution to [this](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge) challenge.  
I have also created a version of this in [Ruby](https://github.com/AdamusBG/bowling-challenge-ruby).  

## Scoring in Bowling  

Bowling consists of ten frames (AKA turns) in which (usually) two rolls are made to try and knock over pins.  
Scoring is not a matter of just adding up the knocked over pins.  
There are special rules to consider when:  

- A spare is rolled (all ten pins in two rolls)  
- A strike is rolled (all ten pins in one roll)  
- A double is rolled (two strikes in a row)  
- A turkey is rolled (three strikes in a row)  
- A four-bagger is rolled (four strikes in a row) - also five-bagger, six-bagger and so on  
- In the final frame

## How to use

Use the terminal on your computer to navigate to a directory in which you want to save the project to and enter:  

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AdamusBG/bowling-challenge.git
$ cd bowling-challenge
$ open views/index.html
```

The program will then open in your browser, enter your score for each roll and watch the scorecard update.
