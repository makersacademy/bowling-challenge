Bowling Challenge
=================


## The Task

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.


### Optional Extras

In any order you like:

* Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.
* Set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to run your tests.
* Add [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to your codebase and make your code conform.

You might even want to start with ESLint early on in your work â€” to help you
learn Javascript conventions as you go along.
