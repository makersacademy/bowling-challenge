Bowling Challenge
==================
This is my proposal for the Makers Academy Weekend Challenge 5: the Bowling Challenge.

What is this challenge about?
----

This program is a bowling scorecard built using JavaScript. It allows you to add your bowling scores for each roll and it calculates the bonuses and total score for you.

Approach to solve the challenge
-------
To solve the challenge, we have used the following software:
- JavaScript (with its jQuery library)
- Jasmine for the tests
- HTML for the view file

The following structure has been implemented:

- A src folder with the following JavaScript files: the game and frame class, and the interface
- An index.html file acting as the single-page view file. This file is in turn linked to the files in the src folder
- A public folder with the .css file
- A spec folder with all our unit tests
- A SpecRunner.html file to run the tests

Setup
-------
1. Download this repository
2. Open this directory in the command line
3. Run _open index.html_

Test
-----

1. Open this directory in the command line
2. Run _open SpecRunner.html_
