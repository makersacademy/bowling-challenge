# Bowling Challenge - JavaScript

Our weekend challenge for the sixth week of the Makers Academy boot camp was to revisit the Bowling Challenge we'd previously completed in Ruby, but this time in JavaScript.

This marked my introduction to JS, so the code here might contain a number of inadvertently flaunted conventions.

## My Approach

For the sake of simplicity, I decided to set it up the same way as [I did using Ruby](https://github.com/jonnyabrams/bowling-challenge-ruby), calculating the score for a whole game at once rather than live and on-the-go. After all, we weren't asked to make it a playable game, just a functioning scorecard.
