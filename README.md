## Description

Bowl'd Away counts and sums the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript). Click buttons to generate 'rolls' and your score is returned to you.

Bowl'd Away aims to simulate as much of the bowling scoring experience as possible. This means 'X' for strikes, '/' for spares and a realistic bowling scoresheet.

### Rules

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.
