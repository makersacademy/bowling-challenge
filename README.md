Bowling Challenge
=================

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

## How to use
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/Cloudy1986/bowling-challenge.git`
2. `$ cd bowling-challenge`
3. See the scores for 3 example games (game, gutterGame and perfectGame) by running `$ node rungames.js`
