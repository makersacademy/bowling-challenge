The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

Code Review
-----------

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Note that referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want.

How I Found This Challenge
-----------

Having looked at this challenge last last weekend I originally decided the logic looked so difficult that I wouldn't attempt this challenge but I wanted to give it a go to see if I could do it. Ok, I haven't done perfect job and yes I had to research and find a lot of information on the internet to make it work but I feel like I've checkout out a good solution. By having a go and spendning and day creating this I feel that I have gained from the experience and learnt a lot in the process. I feel I have brushed up and further developed my JS skills and testing in Jasmine. I really enjoyed getting my head around the difficult logic in the end.
