Bowling Challenge
=================

* Weekend Challenge fow week 6 of the Makers Academy
* At the moment the logic for this is pretty much complete, with a CLI on the works
* Do not try to use the CLI as this is incomplete and will not work correctly


## Reflections

* It will be interesting to revisit this a bit later once we learn more about running Javascript applications in the browser.
* Purely building logic without thinking about the interface can be tricky for future implementations
* This was a translation of the Ruby bowling challenge from week 5
* It migh be worth investigating if best practices for Ruby are still valid for Javascript
