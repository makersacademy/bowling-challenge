### To Do

In any order you like:

* Fix bonus scoring perRoll call point
* Add message after roll?
* Add errors if user input is over 10 per roll or frame
* Create messages for perfect roll and gutter game

* Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.
* Set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to run your tests.
* Add [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to your codebase and make your code conform.


You might even want to start with ESLint early on in your work â€” to help you
learn Javascript conventions as you go along.

## Code Review

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).
