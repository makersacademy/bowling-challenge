10 Pin Bowling Score board

Task
-------
I created a program capable of calculating the score of a game of bowling (single player) based on the amount of pins knocked down, and it takes into consideration possible strikes or spares and their bonuses.

The UI consists of a score board with three columns: rolls, score and frame total. Each game consists of 20 rolls and 10 pins per frame. Two rolls make up one frame, hence the board displays the total score for each frame. The 10 pins are reset after every frame.

Strategy
----------
I test drove the development of my bowling score board using Jasmine and JavaScript. I used JQuery for manipulating the web page and CSS for styling.


Installation
-----------

Clone repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:enonnai/bowling.git
$ cd bowling

To run the Jasmine tests, please copy the path to SpecRunner.html to your browser.
