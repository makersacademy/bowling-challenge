Bowling Scorecard
=================
Task
-------
I aimed to create a program that could count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

Strategy
----------
I wrote my program in JavaScript and test drove the development of my scorecard using Jasmine.

jQuery was used for event-handling.

My interface was designed on CodePen.io using HTML and CSS.


Installation
-----------

Clone repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:nazwhale/bowling-scorecard.git
$ cd bowling-scorecard
```
