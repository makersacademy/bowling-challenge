# WEEKS 5 & 6 - BOWLING Challenge

To build a scoring program for bowling.

## Getting Started

I finished this challenge and also did the bonus of an interface with HTML and JQuery. I have organised all files into their respective folders.

### Prerequisites

You should be able to run it via the bowling.html file in the root folder.

## Running the tests

The tests for the primary JS files are comprehensive and all passing.

### REFLECTION

I was very happy with how this turned out, though it was a challenge. I didn't use any walkthroughs or references and did the project mainly from my own research. As such my methods were sometimes more intricate than necessary.


### WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE

I got everything to work and the program is fairly robust. I would have liked more time for the front end as well as refactoring the main files. However with the time available. I found this to be a very useful exercise.
