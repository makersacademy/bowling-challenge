Bowling Challenge
=================



The task
----
Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).



**User stories**

```
As a player
So that I can play bowling
I want to start a game

As a player
So that I can see how many points I'm getting
I want to score a frame

As a player
So that I can get bonus points
I want to do strikes and spares
```

This challenge was really complicated for me. After implementing the logic of a single frame, I got stuck on the design and couldn't proceed with the implementation of calculating the score for Strikes and Spares.
