Bowling Challenge
=================

    Test time: Friday, the entire day and the weekend if you need it.
    Feel free to use Google, your notes, and your books.

Task: 
-----

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).


Logic: 
------

* the game is an array, with each frame its own array
* logic for adding spare and strike bonus scores works retrospectively
* if previous frame contains a spare, add this roll again
* if previous frame contains a strike, add this roll again
* if previous frame by two contains a strike, add this roll again

* if frame10, if either roll1 or roll1 + roll2 = 10, roll3


### Optional Extra

Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.

## 10th frame

## Gutter Game

A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).

## Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.
