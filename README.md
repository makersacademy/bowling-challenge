Bowling Challenge
=================

Welcome to Ten Pin Bowling, a week 5/6 weekend challenge from Makers Academy. This game is based on the standard rules of ten pin bowling.

I used the Math.random() function in Javascript for the purpose of the pins being knocked down. I used Javascript to compile the game logic whilst using Jasmine to test every step of the way. To present my game in a playable format I used HTML, CSS and jQuery.
