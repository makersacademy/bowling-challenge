# Bowling Scoreboard

This project implements a bowling scoreboard in JavaScript. The scoreboard keeps track of the number of pins knocked down in each roll and calculates the score for a game based on the rolls.

## Features

- Track the number of pins knocked down in each roll.
- Calculate the score for a game, accounting for strikes and spares.
- Handle regular frames, strikes, and spares according to the rules of bowling.
- Supports a maximum of 10 frames per game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shakhrai8/bowling-challenge_js.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bowling-challenge_js
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

- Run the following command in the root:

  ```bash
  node game.js
  ```

  The program will prompt you to enter the number of pins knocked down in each roll.
  It will display the current score, any strikes or spares, and calculate the total score at the end of the game.

## Testing

The project includes test cases to verify the correctness of the scoring logic. To run the tests, you can use a testing framework like Jest. Make sure you have the dependencies installed (npm install) and run the tests using the following command:

```bash
jest
```
