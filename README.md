Bowling Challenge
==================

## I documented my approach in 'kd_approach.md' <---- Please read me! :)
- I documented and explained the processes and approaches I used for this challenge

Next time I come round to looking at this I want to:

## Introduction to the project

This project is part of Week 5 and 6 of the Makers Academy 12-week software engineering programme. 

The aim of this project is to build a bowling scorecard using JavaScript. The bowling score will enable a simple count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

## Motivation: What are my goals for this project?

#### For this challenge, I am specifically targeting the following Makers Academy goals:

- I write code which is easy to change

#### Relating to the above high-level goals, I would like to:

- Document and explain the processes and approaches I used

> This is presented in: 'kd_approach.md'.

Concrete things
- Apply the Jasmine JS testing framework
- Build a user interface to add to the business logic (model of bowling scorecard) to enable interaction with underlying logic.
- Manipuate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript and jQuery to create the user interactions and link to the business logic.

Concepts
- Understand constructor and prototype patterns for JavaScript
- Implement closure patterns to make object properties private

Processes
- Use test-driven development to test-drive the app. I will be applying the Jasmine JS testing framework for my JavaScript. I would like to apply the use of Capybara for feature testing the user flow.
- Break down the requirements into business logic model, representing simple model of bowling scorecard and iterate to create an initial MVP and add to that MVP by creating a user interface.

Behaviours/mindset
- Take a step back to understand how the user journey might work

## Tech/Framework Used

Jasmine will be used as the testing framework for JavaScript.

>"Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests." 

See documentation:
https://jasmine.github.io/

As a final step, I will explore options for hosting my web app. 

## Code Style

I used `ESLint` as a guide.

## How to use the app

The app is available here:

I decided to host the app using .... The app was deployed using  ......

## Images/Screenshots

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/kimdiep/bowling-challenge.git`

## Running tests

Tests can be run from the root directory using:

`open SpecRunner.html`

This will open the SpecRunner.html file in a web browser.
