ABOUT:		

This is a project/challenge set by the coding bootcamp Makers Academy and then completed by the AUTHOR as a learning assignment.


The challenge is the well-known bowling game scoresheet Kata in Javascript.

MY APPROACH:

I prioritized separation of concerns - which, although made the challenge more difficult, it ensures the game is more modifiable over the long run.


THINGS I NEED TO DO


1. Implement special BONUS round for 10th frame.
2. Running total for the player.  
3. UI
4. Optional 2 player/vs computer


CLASSES:

Frame
  Responsible for individual frames
ScoreSheet
  Responsible for the score sheet as a whole
Player
  User interface - can only roll.
