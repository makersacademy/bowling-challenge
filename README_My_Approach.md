# Bowling Challenge

First I read about the game and rules on wikipedia. I proceeded to decide what my constructors will look like and what methods they will have. I decided to implement code for a normal game and then include bonus once the basic structure is ready. Later I realised that the 10th frame was special, it was very similar to other frames in many ways but it can have up to 3 rolls. So decided on making a constructor for the last frame. Now the code doesn't seem DRY but there are sutle differences between methods from Frame and LastFrame. The front end is not finished. Will work on front and backend when time permits.

I wish I had not hardcoded the creation of Frames and Rolls. It would have been good if I could create the objects on document load and inject them inside the Game.Hopefully next week with JavaScript would give me some more idea about how to decouple the objects even more.

Looked at Mary's count program for dir structure :)
