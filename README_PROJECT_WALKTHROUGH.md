## PROJECT WALKTHROUGH ##

In this readme i will explain step by step my development proccess for this challenge.

## PROJECT SETTING.

First of all i set up the directorie organization for the project and the  test environment, in this project i will be using Jasmine framework for testing.

I ve just dowloaded the files pack and the current version of the framework is 3.5.0

[jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)
[jasmine download](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases)

Once downloaded i have placed the structure in the project root and configured the files en SpecRunner.html. The thing to do is to link the files of the project in here

 - SpecRunner.html :

    ```
    <!-- include source files here... -->
    <script src="src/Game.js"></script>

    <!-- include spec files here... -->
    <script src="spec/GameSpec.js"></script>


    ```

  Once that is done it is possible to run the html file and observe this page in the web explorer of your choice.

  At this point of the proccess i make the first commit and start the developtment from this moment.
  - First commit.
