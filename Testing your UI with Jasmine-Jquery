Testing your UI with Jasmine-Jquery

Jasmine-Jquery is a handy little tool which provides a set of custom matchers for UI testing, much like Capybara does. To get started, download the Jasmine-Jquery source code from here: https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery and save it in a file in lib/jasmine-2.3.4 called jasmine-jquery.js.
