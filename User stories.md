As a player
So I can keep my score at bowling
I would like to count and sum the scores entered.

Each frame will consist of 2 rolls, except frame 10 which could be up to 3 rolls.

If rolls 1 and 2 equal 10, this is a spare, and the score from the next roll must be added to the current frame.

If I get a strike the scores from the next 2 rolls must be added to the current frame.

No more scores can be entered after frame 10 has completed.
