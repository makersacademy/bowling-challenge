Don't worry about css/jquery tricks straight away.

First aim for:
  - The individual frame scores to be on the screen
  - There to be a box for entering the current score
  - Final score in the last box
  - Won't let you do anything when the game is over.
- Complete!

Expanded design:
  - Buttons instead of boxes for entering the current score. 
    - Complete
  - Disappearing buttons for score validation
    - Incomplete, last round has some weirdness.
  - Keep track of all scores as you go along by adding the bowl to the page.
    - Try to make it look a bit more like actual bowling looks.
  - CSS styling.
