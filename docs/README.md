# Bowling Challenge

This challenge is to write a Bowling Scorecard Program in Javascript. 

## Scope and functionality
* This is not a bowling game, simply a scorecard program for a single player
* There will not be a database implementation
* There will not be a user interface
* Inputs will be generated by the users and not randomly generated
* This will be tested through the rspec only, where these will "mock' the user input

## Motivation
Weekend challenge Week 6

## Ruby version
3.0.0

## Creators
Jane

## Design
* The Class Diagram and the Flow Diagram and be found under 'docs'

## How to run/test
* This project is self testing.
* To check out various games, go to the bottom of the bowler.js file and
* a) either uncomment one of the example games provided there, or
* b) add the set of rolls/bowls for a game of your choice
* c) then run the project by 'node bowler.js' from the command line

## TODO's
* check out rubocop - not even run
* check out code coverage - set up and run
