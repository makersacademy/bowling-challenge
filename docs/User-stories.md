As a bowling player
so that I can keep record of the pins I knocked down in a frame
I want to be able to enter their number after each roll.

As a bowling player
so that I can keep record of my score
I want to see my score on the screen.

As a bowling player
so that I don't have to calculate bonuses
I want to see my score inclusive of strikes and spares.

As a bowling player
so that I know when the game ends
I want to be notified of the end of the game and see my final score.
