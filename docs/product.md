# Bowling Scores Calculator
An app that calculates bowling scores for a single player, in JavaScript.

## Vision
An app using some nice, swanky jQuery that doesn't require page refresh when
you use it. It has nice animation. Comments on your performance, tells you when
You have bowled a perfect game, or a gutter game, or something. Tells you when
You've done a strike. And it's really nicely styled!
