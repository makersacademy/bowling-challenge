#### Business Logic

1. Update the Game class tests and code to include tenth frame being a bonus frame.

### User Interface

1. Disable the buttons on the UI based on how many pins were rolled on the first roll.
2. Throw and catch a Game Over exception and display a 'Game Over' alert message.

### Specs

1. Add Jasmine feature tests - gutter game, perfect game, in between (unit tests extensively cover all scenarios so don't go overboard)

### Documentation

1. Update algorithm to include tenth frame being a bonus frame.
2. Create a scenarios table and link it to algorithm so that actions required for different scenarios can be visualised.
