# Jasmine Matchers Protractor Example

## System Dependencies

Protractor requires you to have the [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) manually installed beforehand.

## Running Tests

1. Run `npm start` to start the Selenium Server which Protractor will send requests to.
1. Leave the Server running then open another Terminal Session in another window.
1. In the new Terminal window, run `npm test`.
1. Return to the Server Terminal and hit Ctrl+C to stop the Server.

## Configuration

Jasmine Matchers is loaded by adding `node_modules/jasmine-expect/index.js` as the first item in the
`specs` array in `./conf.js`.
