### How I worked on this weekend challenged (16 November 2019)

1. Installed ESLint.
2. TDD simple functions to calculate sum for single roll, and for 10 rolls (without logic for strike/spare).
3. Developed a simple interface (JQuery) to get user's input.
4. Added function to check for strikes or spares.
5. Added functions to interface to get the scores from user and to display rolls (nested array). Added a submit button to calculate score (sum of elements in array).
6. Worked on JS file to define logic for the score. Linked JS to interface. 
7. Refactored interface: deleted "calculate score" button - score displayed after clicking on "submit" button. Final score displayed on a different page.
8. Updated on 15 December 2019: added table to display rolls for each frame.
