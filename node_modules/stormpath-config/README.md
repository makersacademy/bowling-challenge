This library is responsible for loading the Stormpath configuration.  It is an internal module used by stormpath-node-sdk, and express-stormpath, and is
not meant for general consumption.


## Installation

To install this library, just run:

```
$ npm install stormpath-config --save
```


## Usage

First, start by including the library:

```
var stormpathConfig = require('stormpath-config');
```

Once the library is loaded, you'll need to initialize a new `Loader` object using the library like so:

```
var configLoader = new stormpathConfig.Loader([/* strategies */]);
```

Notice how the first argument is commented out. This needs to be an array of one or many strategies. See [strategies](#strategies)Â for a list of all supported strategies and on how to create your own.

E.g. below demonstrates how the Stormpath configuration can be created and loaded from only the environment.

```
var strategy = stormpathConfig.strategy;

var configLoader = new StormpathConfig.Loader([
    new strategy.LoadEnvConfigStrategy(),
    new strategy.LoadFileConfigStrategy('~/stormpath.yml')
]);
```

Now, once you got your new `Loader` object all you need to do is call the `configLoader.load(callback)` method to load the configuration data.
You can do this like so:

```
configLoader.load(function (err, config) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log("Configuration loaded:", config);
  }
});
```

## Strategies

### Creating your own strategy

A strategy is simply a prototype that implements a method named `process` that takes the parameters `config` and `callback`. All it expects is that the callback is called with the first argument as an error (null if none) and the second containing the modified/processed config. E.g. as shown below:

```
function MyConfigStrategy () {
}

MyConfigStrategy.prototype.process = function (config, callback) {
  // Apply strategy to config and return result in callback
  config.someNewField = "abc"; // Append someNewField to our config
  callback(null, config);
};
```

### Supported

Some default strategies for loading a configuration has been included. These are accessible through the `strategy` export. I.e. `require('stormpath-config').strategy`.

#### LoadEnvConfigStrategy

Loads configuration from the system environment.

#### LoadAPIKeyConfigStrategy

Loads client API key configuration from a .properties file.

#### LoadFileConfigStrategy

Loads a configuration from either a JSON or YAML file.

#### ExtendConfigStrategy

Extend a the configuration with an existing object.

#### EnrichClientConfigStrategy

Enriches the configuration with client config resolved at runtime.

#### EnrichClientFromRemoteConfigStrategy

Enriches the configuration with client config resolved from the Stormpath API.

#### EnrichIntegrationConfigStrategy

Enriches the configuration with integration config resolved at runtime.

#### EnrichIntegrationFromRemoteConfigStrategy

Enriches the configuration with integration config resolved from the Stormpath API.

#### ValidateClientConfigStrategy

Validates the client configuration.
