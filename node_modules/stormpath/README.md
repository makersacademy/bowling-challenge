*A simple user management library for Node.js.*

This library is a wrapper for the [Stormpath][] REST API.  It is a collection of
methods that allow you to create, modify, and update resources in the REST API,
without having to manually make HTTP calls from your own code.

[Stormpath][] is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-
on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpath's intuitive API and expert support
make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage and secure users and roles
in any application.

This library provides low-level access to all of Stormpath's features, to name
a few:

- Robust authentication and authorization.
- Schemaless user data.
- Social login with Facebook and Google OAuth.
- Generate and manage API keys for your service.
- Stateless authentication with JWTs.

Because this library gives you basic low-level access to the REST API only, it
may not always be the best choice for the problem that you are trying to solve.
If you want to work with a more comprehensive framework integration, please see
the other libraries that are listed below.


## Documentation

This library is fully documented with JsDoc, please visit the site here:
[Stormpath Node.js SDK Documentation][]


## Install

```bash
npm install stormpath
```


## Usage

Everything starts with a [Client][] instance, which you create like so:

```javascript
// Assumes API keys are in environment variables, or stormpath.yaml

var stormpath = require('stormpath');

var client = new stormpath.Client();
```

With a [Client][] instance, you can do many operations, like fetching all of the
accounts in your Stormpath Tenant:

```javascript
// Fetch all the accounts in my Stormpath Tenant

client.getAccounts(function(err, accountsCollection) {
  accountsCollection.each(function(account, next) {
    console.log(account);
    next();
  });
});
```


## Other Libraries

This library is a low-level wrapper for the [Stormpath][] REST API.  We also
provide high-level libraries for popular frameworks, these libraries provide
default views for login and registration, as well as many other features for
adding authentication and authorization to your full-stack web or mobile
application.

- [Express-Stormpath][] - A deep integration with Express that will add default
  view for authentication, and provide a JSON API for front-end and mobile
  clients to use for authentication.

- [Stormpath Angular SDK][] - This library provides default login and registration
  views in your Angular application, and communicates with [Express-Stormpath][]
  via its JSON API to authenticate the user, and tell Angular about the logged-in
  user.  This library can be used with other back-end frameworks, for more
  integrations see https://docs.stormpath.com

- [Stormpath React SDK][] - This library provides routes and components for
  React that will allow you to solve common user management tasks using Stormpath,
  such as login and signup.  It communicates with [Express-Stormpath][] via
  its JSON API to authenticate the user and provide user context to your React
  application.  This library can be used with other back-end frameworks, for more
  integrations see https://docs.stormpath.com
