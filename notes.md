##How to Calculate Bonuses For Strikes and Spares

If you get one strike:

Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins
Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins
The total score from these throws is:
* Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19
* Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9
TOTAL = 28

As the player got a strike on the first frame the points from the next two balls get added to the total of the first frame as a bonus.

If you get two strikes in a row:

Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
Frame 3, ball 1: 9 pins
Frame 3, ball 2: 0 pins (recorded as a dash '-' or '0' on the scoresheet)
The total score from these throws is:
* Frame one: 10 + (10 + 9) = 29
* Frame two: 10 + (9 + 0) = 19
* Frame three: 9 + 0 = 9
TOTAL = 57

As the player got a strike on the second frame too the bonus still takes into account the next two balls and therefore the 10 from frame 2 and the 9 from the first ball of frame 3 are the bonus for frame 1. This works consecutively down the table.

If you get three strikes in a row (including if you get a spare

Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
Frame 3, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
Frame 4, ball 1: 8 pins
Frame 4, ball 2: 2 pins (Spare)
Frame 5, ball 1: 8 pins
Frame 5, ball 2: 1 pin, but player stepped across foul line during throw (Foul)
The total score from these throws is:
* Frame one: 10 + (10 + 10) = 30
* Frame two: 10 + (10 + 8) = 28
* Frame three: 10 + (8 + 2) = 20
* Frame four: 10 + 8 = 18
* Frame five: 8 + 1 = 9
TOTAL = 104

This works in the same way but shows how it continues down the table. For a spare you get the bonus of the next 1 ball only added as a bonus (as you can see with frame four).

10th frame 3 possible attempts
Each one only counts as the number of pins you get down.
If with either of the first two balls you get a strike or a spare you get a third additional ball.
These strikes/spares have no bonus but the values from them can be used as bonusâ€™ for the 8th/9th frame should they be strikes/spares.
