## Other things to work on this weekend/next week

- Reflect on my overall process - define what I do  - how do I debug? how do I refactor? and where I could be better?
- Reflect on the weekly goals - what have I achieved?
- What was my approach to this week? How did I actually learn a new language? What went well and what didn't?
- Write feedback for Bart and Henry

## My project setup

1. Run `npm i -g eslint` for the linter
2. Add lib/jasmine-3.3.0 to the directory and SpecRunner.html to root directory
3. Add spec and src folders
4. Add bowlingSpec.js
5. Update SpecRunner.html to include the test file

## To run tests

To run Jasmine tests, type `open -a "Google Chrome" SpecRunner.html` into the console

## To run the linter (eslint)

To run the linter, type `eslint lib/**` (this might need double quotes around the folder)
