  >Number of rolls in each frame 

>Store the score 
  >Overall score 
  >Score for each frame 

  ### Game ###

  # Frame 1 
    # Roll 1 - Player enters score 
        # if score == 10 
          # skip to frame 2
          # score = 10 
          # bonus points of next two rolls
        # else
          # roll again - enter score
            # if roll_1 + roll_2 == 10 
              # score = 10 
              # bonus points of next roll to be added on 
            # else 
              # score = score = roll_1 + roll_2
            # end
        # end 

 # Do this 10 times 

  ### Dealing with strikes ###

  #Store scores from each frame in a hash
    #key is @current_frame
    #value is array containing scores for each roll 

    #For each frame iterate through the scores 
      #if the score is a strike 
        #add the points from the next frame to tge score of the current_frame 


### Dealing with bonus rolls after frame 10 ###

  #Frame 10 
    # if scores[10].length == 1
      #bonus_1 = gets.chomp 
      #bonus_2 = gets.chomp
      #@scores[:bonus] = bonus_1 + bonus_2
    # else scores[10].sum == 10 
        #bonus_1 = gets.chomp
        #@scores[:bonus] = bonus_1
    # end
