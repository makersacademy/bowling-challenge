# Process


## Initial
- Built basic frame and scorecard infrastructure.
- Scorecard takes 10 instances of frames.
- Frame takes two scores, one from each turn

#### Thoughts

- Will test for edge cases in frame later on once happy case working.
Examples:
- Two scores cant add > 10
- Score 2 = 0 if score 1 = 10


- Going to be difficult to deal with arrays within array.
