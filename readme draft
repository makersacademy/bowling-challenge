How I tackled the challenge

Having only had 5 days learning Javascript prior to this challenge
I was looking forward to this challenge.

I started off by creating two different functions in two different
files and trying to get these both to work with each other.
I ran into some issues here which I could not resolve, and
due to the time constraints, I decided to write this program
using only the Game.js file and then see if I can split it up afterwards

Ruby differs from Javascript, but this challenge helped me to cement
my understanding of JS, and using the TDD techniques learnt with
Ruby and Rspec, I could now apply this to Jasmine.

I made certain to write a test before implimenting the code, and using this
process really helped break down the challenge for me.
This challenge was a lot more logic heavy than previous ones
and focusing on small bits at a time helped me get my test passing, bit by bit.


Stuggles

Have yet to refactor this properly yet, but I'm still getting to grips with
writing shorter functions in JS and making them single responsiblity.

This was especially challenging for the functions that had a lot of logic involved.
