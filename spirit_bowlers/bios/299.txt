Favourite Movie Character: Genevi√®ve Emery

Favourite quote: "In Evelyn's face, I saw the travels of Marco Polo, the fall of Constantinople, the irredentist yearnings of Hungaro-Romanians. How many ancestors vanished when Evelyn had her teeth fixed? In Evelyn's face I saw the hordes of Genghis Khan invading Poland. Among them was a yellow brute, with a long mustache flowing away from his nostrills like black ribbons. He raped Evelyn's great-great-great-grandmother with his fierce prick, thereby giving a distinctly slanted plane to Evelyn's cheekbones, her nicest feature."
