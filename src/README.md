A Bowling score card.

Spy-testing didn't work when it got complex. 


## Ways the game can end
- All fresh frames gone. No strike or spare in the 10th frame.
- spare in the 10th frame: One bonus roll (no matter if bonus roll is a strike or not.)
- strike in the 10th frame. Complete bonus frame with two rolls. Both could be strikes without effect.


##Bonus calculations:
- If frame.strike => add following two rolls from scorecard as bonus
- If frame.spare => add next frames first roll as bonus
