Game of bowling

================

As a bowler
So that I can have a competitive game
I would like to be able to keep score on my game

As a bowler
So that my scoring can be as full-featured as possible
I would like to incorporate gutter games and perfect games into my scoring

As a bowler
So that I can have a more realistic scoring for my bowling game
I would like to incorporate spikes and spares into my scoring

As a bowler
So that I can have even more realistic scoring for my game of bowling
I would like to be able to do the stuff that real bowlers do on the 10th frame
