```

As a bowler
So that I can begin a game
I would like to create a scoresheet with my name


As a bowler
So that I can keep track of each frame
I would like the result of each frame I play to be saved


As a bowler
So that I can know how well Iâ€™m doing
I would like my total score to be updated each frame


As a bowler
So that I can be rewarded for high scoring frames
I would like to receive appropriate bonuses for strikes and spares


As a bowler
So that I maximize my score
I would like a spare in the tenth frame to trigger an additional roll


As a bowler
So that I maximize my score
I would like a strike in the tenth frame to trigger two additional rolls
