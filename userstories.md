As a player
So that I can record my score for a game of bowling
I can start a new game

As a player,
So that I can keep a record of my scores,
I want to be able to add a score for a roll.

As a player
So that I can keep track of a full game
I can record my score for 10 frames

As a player
So that I can view game progress
I can see the full scorecard after adding a score
