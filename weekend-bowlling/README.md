**User stories**

As a player,
So that I can see the score of my bowling game,
I would like to be able to check my bowling score.

As a player,
So that I know my score for every roll,
I would like to record the number of pins I stroke.

As a player,
So that I know my score for every frame,
I would like to know what frame I am in, and what was my score until now.

As a player,
So that I can know my score for every roll through the Gutter Game,
I would like to be able to record all the scores when no pins have been stricken.

*More user stories to be developed during the further work on this project.*

**Progress and limitations**

While I was able to develop the logic for three out if six MVP features (one frame, multiple frames, gutter game), I did not create the three remaining features (spares, strikes and final game). The user interface also remains to be done. The main issue was the time limitation for this project created by the external circumstances. Additionally, this is an effect of one week of learning JavaScript, and hence the use of JS is basic.

I will revisit this assignment and work on finalisation of the implementation.

**Storage on GitHub and pull request**

Since initially I started working on the clone of the repo the history of development of the project is available on this GitHub repository: https://github.com/ajmpawlik/weekend-bowlling In order to submit a pull request, I created a fork and committed to it the final(at this point in time) version of my code.
